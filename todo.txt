## Todo
- [ ] Allow entering of coordinates via a vector or string to make setting up puzzles for testing quicker. Don't forget to take out set_const_cell!
- [ ] Add in terminal GUI or use QT.
- [ ] Addd support for Travis CI
	- [ ] Test mode
- [ ] Consider adding [] element access operator to sodoku and matrix.
- [ ] Change writable_state to bools.
- [ ] Consider instead of using hints, to start solving the puzzle in diffirent locations (or both!).
- [ ] Add where bound checking occurs.
- [ ] Remove sanity check from Square_Matrix.
- [ ] Take out working_cell from class variable into approriate functions.

## Complete
- [Y] Make functions const and function parameters const ref's where approriate
- [Y] Remove can_set check from increment cell contents for preformance.
- [Y] Solving a puzzle of size 1, 2 causes a crash or hang.
- [Y] Rename columns to x and rows to y.
- [Y] Check what's up with missing documentation in doxygen terminal output.
- [Y] Document Sodoku object.
- [Y] Remove bounds check in Square matrix for preformance.
- [Y] Consider taking out out of bounds check for can_set for speed increase.
- [Y] Consider taking out display_writable.
- [Y] Move check column + row into private section of class.
- [Y] Get rid of big working_cell undefined comment in solve_puzzle.
- [Y] Clean check_sodoku_validity.
- [Y] Take out messege capability for displaying the heatmap and writable
- [Y] Clean up {'s so they start on the same line where needed.
- [Y] Take out kept for debugging nonsense.
- [Y] Set_cell bounds check should be changed >=, not > something - 1.
- [Y] Get rid of word constructor for description of constructor.
- [Y] Spaces between briefs and details and params and returns.
- [Y] Shut down threads when we found a thread with a solution.
- [Y] Update compilation instructions.
- [Y] Change test.cpp to main.cpp (kept test.cpp, made main.cpp)
- [Y] Say if using backtrack or recusrion in program start.
- [Y] Display num_steps
- [Y] Change partial fill to use the backtracking algo but somehow limited.
- [Y] Change names for increment decrement cell to indicate we are changing contents.
- [Y] Use matrix.Get/Set and Soduku.Get/Set correctly. In class use matrix only.
- [Y] set_const_cell needs info for it not being used for anything but unit tests.
- [Y] Fix upper and lower case diffirences.
- [Y] Add warning if trying to fill more than 9 cells to indicate solving could take a while.
- [Y] Fix description for solve_puzzle when taking away solve_Status.
- [Y] Change can_set description
- [Y] Prompt user for puzzle size.
- [Y] User defines size of sodoku puzzle
- [Y] Remove Attempted Cells
- [Y] Remove solve Status.
- [Y] Add test and fix for when the first cell is unset.
- [Y] Have display() output an input string.
- [Y] Have the tests run before the the main program.
- [Y] Use an "unset" var of -1
- [Y] When using display, display nothing for unset var's
- [Y] Impliment row + column check taking into account unset vars
- [Y] Fill in some cells by dividing size by filling in 15% with at least 1 cell.
- [Y] Add padding to display depending on if 1 digit ints or 2 digit ints.
